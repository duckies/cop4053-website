Our second exam took place Monday of this week, so we were able to spend a minimal amount of this week studying. We all went around and shared the link to our Google Forms playtest survey with our friends to get feedback on the current state of our game. We met to dicuss the results and drafted up documents containing the survey results and our plans moving forward in development. During the weekend, we were able to make some additional progress on our game's snowy area.

### John

I was occupied this week with the exam and working on my senior design project. It was also good to take a break and allow for the feedback before we change things around. Some of the feedback was useful but has been difficult to replicate. So I've been unsure if we disable features that are potentially buggy for the sake of that off-chance someone gets stuck, or try to add some more checks and hope for the best. We also decided on how to spend the rest of our time that wasn't devoted to dealing with feedback, so we're now adding our last areas to the game.

### Will
I basically only made the sketches for the remaining plants this week – I once again was doing the survey analysis and also doing the second half of my class exams. I’ll come back and post the final versions of my plants when they’re done, but realistically, the plants are the easiest thing to code in now that we already have a system for them working, so I may be doing them absolutely last.
### Quynh
Similar to the rest of my team, I spent my Monday reviewing materials for the exam. The rest of the week I spent on pressuring my friends to take our game survey.  
### Michaela
Like most of the team, I spent my Monday studying in last-minute preparation for our exam. I met with everyone else to pitch some ideas for our playtesting iteration plan and was able to show a few videos of bugs that our playtesters were able to catch. I spent more time than I'd like to admit trying to replicate the bug where the player gets stuck in the floor, and we're still not entirely sure what exactly causes it.
