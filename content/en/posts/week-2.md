This week was a focus on getting the initial setup completed. We walked through getting our AWS remote server and Perforce set up together and made some design mockups.

With the help of Michaela and John, I managed to connect to the server and set up Perforce.

### Michaela
This week I deployed our AWS remote server using the free tier and set up Perforce. I made a new Unity project for our team, uploaded it to Perforce, and called a group meeting for the week to troubleshoot any Perforce issues my team members were having and ensure that everyone was properly connected to the remote server.
