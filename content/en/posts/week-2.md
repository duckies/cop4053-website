This week was a focus on getting the initial setup completed. We walked through getting our AWS remote server and Perforce set up together and made some design mockups.

## Contributions

### John

I spent this week exploring isometric game design in Unity. There were a few methodologies each with their own design challenges and implementation quirks.

### Will

Primarily, I spent this week just preparing some concepts based around the art style ideas that we had previously come up with, making mock layouts of what our game should look like as well as the assets below. Trying to arrange the gameplay in a more isometric style, we decided that the Donâ€™t Starve aesthetic would probably work the best for us.

### Quynh
With the help of Michaela and John, I managed to connect to the server and set up Perforce.

### Michaela
This week I deployed our AWS remote server using the free tier and set up Perforce. I made a new Unity project for our team, uploaded it to Perforce, and called a group meeting for the week to troubleshoot any Perforce issues my team members were having and ensure that everyone was properly connected to the remote server.
