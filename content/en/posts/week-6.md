After our first playable, our first order of business was to clean up the starting area/main hub of our game and make it presentable. Our members worked on expanding this area to include more plots, a more complex layered area design and ladders to traverse it, some simple tutorial dialogue, and environmental decorations (fences, flowers, singposts etc.). Although not final, we ensured that our game's main tree would grow and change states in accordance with the growth of our other miscellaneous plants in the game.

My main task was environmental development-- adding platforms, decorations, and in general, planning the layout of our game's cave. I added some tilesets at the top of the cave to simulate the narrow, closed nature of a cave (which also serves to prevent the player from seeing the background seams). I carved out a raised, open area to place our game's tree and added raised platforms and farm plots scattered around the main hub's map. I attached ladders to the raised platforms to allow the player to traverse the map, added additional sources of lighting in the cave, and decorate the map with broken fences and flowers.
