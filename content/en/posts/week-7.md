With our main hub area mostly completed, our next step was to begin development for the forest area. We worked on getting together a basic layout of the forest area and started scripting some new monster behaviors with some basic design prototypes that Will had begun working on. As part of the tutorial, we decided that it would be best to leave a slime in the starting area to teach players the mechanics of battling monsters and working with the inventory system.

### John

This week I had worked with Quynh on building a system for enemies to inherit fighting styles. Our first enemies would be the patroller and turret, with variants for flying patroller and projectiles that seek or do not seek.

For this week, I continued my work with changing the slime's behavior by following some tutorials about coroutines and working with IEnumerators. I also added some character's attacking animations to our game that Will drew. 
### Michaela
Like last week, this week was spent working on our game's tilemap. After a fair amount of trial and error, I was able to get together a nice layout for our game's forest area. I decorated the area with the flower tiles shown below and added ladders and signposts in the appropriate locations. I made sure to playtest the layout of this area a bit to ensure that the area was easily traversible.
