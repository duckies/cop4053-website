In our final (full) week of development, we had to create a PowerPoint for our game's AI presentation for class, which took us a little while to gather resources for. Thankfully, following this we were able to finish up our game's third area, the lava area. The plant assets associated with the lava area were finished this week and enemy behavior was fully scripted. We added a game over screen, additional dialogue, and an official ending to our game.

### John
I had helped write up the challenges we faced when dealing with the farming systems. The system works well, but I do know that you can "store" a gameobject in a tile, I just never investigated it further or figured it out enough to understand more, but our approach works on a smaller scale. Had we been able to re-do the project I would have likely not used farm plots and instead potted plants to more accenuate that they're more of an unlocking pylon of sorts. The new enemies also extended off of the previous ones without much issue, and we're interested to see how that plays out with the ranged mechanics.

### Will
This week was the opposite of last week. I only finished the plants. That’s about it. I guess if I need more than that, I can note that some of these designs I took from our scrapped area four back when our game was going to be isometric – the dice design fore the fire plant coming from the lizard and the weird floating modern art plant from the snowman are ideas I had for plants from that, since that area was supposed to have the most complex plant puzzles originally. Those puzzles didn’t really make it into the final game either – we’ve had a bit of a rough time, honestly.

### Quynh
LIke the rest of the group, I spent some time working on the AI presentation. I help John and Michaela with finishing up the enemy's behavior.

### Michaela
I finalized the lava area's level design and placed the finished scripted enemies throughout the area. I contributed to the tutorial dialogue and did some more playtesting, which uncovered a few more minor ladder bugs that were quickly fixed.
