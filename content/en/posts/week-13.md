In our final (full) week of development, we were able to finish up our game's third area, the lava area. The plant assets associated with the lava area were finished this week and enemy behavior was fully scripted. We added a game over screen, additional dialogue, and an official ending to our game.

## Contributions
 
### John

I had helped add some last-minute polish these last few days. We tried to make sure we added enough story elements as possible, but my work with the scripting was largely over.

### Will
I made the game over and win screens for the game, making use of some of the other assets I’d already made to clean everything up. In addition, I added some loose icons and assets I forgot to make for the weeks prior. To be honest, I also attempted to make unique backgrounds for each region, but if you thought my tilesets were pretty okay, then my backgrounds were… not that. I hope the mix of artstyles isn’t too bad for the players, I wish I could’ve done more overall for the look and feel of the game, but I hope its satisfactory nonetheless.
### Quynh
I made some changes with the enemy's behavior, as well as adding the animation of the character shooting bow and arrow to the game.
### Michaela
I made some final fixes to our game's areas-- adding unique backgrounds and background music to each area. I also lowered the overall game volume (in response to our playtesting feedback) and wrore a few more lines of last minute dialogue for our game's tutorial for the sake of clarity.
